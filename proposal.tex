\maketitle

We propose a class in Asymptotic Analysis as part of the AMCS program at Penn,
aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.
Given the diverse background of AMCS students,
if the department is more ambitious about this class, it may be best splitting 
this course into two classes, the first deals with formal computations 
and important concepts/applications/motivations/simulations while the second
deals with completely rigorous justifications of computations introduced in the
first class.
